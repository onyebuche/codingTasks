**Introduction**
Welcome to the "The Responsive Periodic Table" project. This project is a simple representation of the periodic table of elements using basic HTML and CSS. It aims to demonstrate the use of HTML tables, styling with CSS, and how to organize content in a web page effectively.

**Description**
This coding task involves creating a static web page that displays the periodic table of elements in a responsive way - taking into consideration the size of the output medium. The primary goal is to help beginners understand the structure and styling of HTML tables, as well as the application of CSS for enhancing the visual presentation. Learning to build such a project is crucial because it lays the foundation for understanding more complex web development concepts.

**Installation**
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/onyebuche/codingTasks.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd codingTasks/periodicTable
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. You can do this directly from the file explorer by double-clicking the file, or by using a command like:

open index.html  # For macOS
start index.html # For Windows
No additional installations are required as this is a static HTML project.

**Usage**
To use the periodic table:
Open the index.html file in your browser. You should see a visually structured table displaying various chemical elements, each within a styled cell.

Explore the table: Each cell represents a chemical element, color-coded based on its properties. Hover over different cells to see the effect of CSS styling.

Features
Color Coding: Elements are color-coded to distinguish different categories (e.g., noble gases, alkali metals).
Responsive Design: The table layout adjusts based on screen size, maintaining readability.
Why This Task is Important
Understanding how to structure data using HTML tables and style them with CSS is fundamental for web development. This task provides a practical example of organizing complex data and applying design principles to enhance user experience.
